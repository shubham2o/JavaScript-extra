        <h1>Accessing array elements</h1>
        <p>There is nothing special about JavaScript arrays and the properties that cause this.
            JavaScript properties that begin with a digit cannot be referenced with dot notation
            and must be accessed using bracket notation.
        </p>
        <p>For example, if you had an object with a property named 3d, it can only be referenced
            using bracket notation.</p>

            let years = [1950, 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010];
            console.log(years.0);
// syntax error ~ Uncaught SyntaxError: missing; after argument list
            console.log(years[0]);
// works properly ~ output will be 1950
