        <!-- Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is 
        calculated using the formula:
        BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg 
        and height in meter).

        Your tasks:
        1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
        2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both 
        versions)
        3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about 
        whether Mark has a higher BMI than John -->
