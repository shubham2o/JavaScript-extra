    <!-- Given an array of forecasted maximum temperatures, the thermometer displays a 
    string with the given temperatures. Example: [17, 21, 23] will print "... 17ºC in 1 
    days ... 21ºC in 2 days ... 23ºC in 3 days ..."

    Your tasks:
    1. Create a function 'printForecast' which takes in an array 'arr' and logs a 
    string like the above to the console. Try it with both test datasets.
   
    2. Use the problem-solving framework: Understand the problem and break it up 
    into sub-problems! -->
